# **_DATA TRANSFORMATIONS WITH MAP, FILTER, AND REDUCE_**

## **_Map_**

- `map` is like the forEach method except it returns a new array based off the transformation made in it's callback function to the original array

## **_Filter_**

- `filter` return a _new array_ containing the array elements that passed a specified _test condition_

## **_Reduce_**

- `reduce` boils ("reduces") all array elements down to one single value (e.g. adding all elements together)
